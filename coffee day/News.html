    <p>According to one legend, ancestors of today's Oromo people in a region of Jimma in Ethiopia were the first to
        recognize the energizing effect of the coffee plant. However, no direct evidence has been found earlier than the
        15th century indicating who among the African populations used it as a stimulant, or where coffee was first
        cultivated. The story of Kaldi, the 9th-century Ethiopian goatherd who discovered the stimulating effect of
        coffee when he noticed how excited his goats became after eating the beans from a coffee plant, did not appear
        in writing until 1671 and is probably apocryphal.[2]

        Another legend attributes the discovery of coffee to Sheikh Omar. According to an old chronicle (preserved in
        the Abd-Al-Kadir manuscript), Omar, who was known for his ability to cure the sick through prayer, was once
        exiled from Mocha in Yemen to a desert cave near Ousab (modern-day Wusab, about 90 kilometres (56 mi) east of
        Zabid, Yemen).[7] Starving, Omar chewed berries from nearby shrubbery but found them to be too bitter. He tried
        roasting the seeds to improve the flavor, but they became hard. He then tried boiling them to soften the seed,
        which resulted in a fragrant brown liquid. Upon drinking the liquid, Omar was revitalized and sustained for
        days. As stories of this "miracle drug" reached Mocha, Omar was asked to return and was made a saint.[8].</p>

       <p>Several species of shrub of the genus Coffea produce the berries from which coffee is extracted. The two main species commercially cultivated are Coffea canephora (predominantly a form known as 'robusta') and C. arabica.[36] C. arabica, the most highly regarded species, is native to the southwestern highlands of Ethiopia and the Boma Plateau in southeastern Sudan and Mount Marsabit in northern Kenya.[37] C. canephora is native to western and central Subsaharan Africa, from Guinea to Uganda and southern Sudan.[38] Less popular species are C. liberica, C. stenophylla, C. mauritiana, and C. racemosa.

        All coffee plants are classified in the large family Rubiaceae. They are evergreen shrubs or trees that may grow 5 m (15 ft) tall when unpruned. The leaves are dark green and glossy, usually 10–15 cm (4–6 in) long and 6 cm (2.4 in) wide, simple, entire, and opposite. Petioles of opposite leaves fuse at the base to form interpetiolar stipules, characteristic of Rubiaceae. The flowers are axillary, and clusters of fragrant white flowers bloom simultaneously. Gynoecium consists of an inferior ovary, also characteristic of Rubiaceae. The flowers are followed by oval berries of about 1.5 cm (0.6 in).[39] When immature, they are green, and they ripen to yellow, then crimson, before turning black on drying. Each berry usually contains two seeds, but 5–10% of the berries[40] have only one; these are called peaberries.[41] Arabica berries ripen in six to eight months, while robusta takes nine to eleven months.[42]
        
        Coffea arabica is predominantly self-pollinating, and as a result, the seedlings are generally uniform and vary little from their parents. In contrast, Coffea canephora, and C. liberica are self-incompatible and require outcrossing. This means that useful forms and hybrids must be propagated vegetatively.[43] Cuttings, grafting, and budding are the usual methods of vegetative propagation.[44] On the other hand, there is great scope for experimentation in search of potential new strains.</p>
